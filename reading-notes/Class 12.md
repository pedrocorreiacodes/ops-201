Open source software that operates on FreeBSD.

One of the best starting points to learn firewalls and routing.

+ Does the same thing as a CISCO firewall but a lot cheaper.

*It can performer routing functions, the amount of interfaces it has depends on the hardware. You can install psSense on a giant tower or a small piece of software or hardware. It will run on anything.*

* Conceptually a router has the hardware component and software component, today we're doing that in Virtual Box.

*A lot of routers can be re-flashed to run psSENSE.*

We can deploy it to Virtual Box to create a *contained LAN*, an internal network isolated into itself.

With psSense's firewall feature we can install security packages as extensions.
