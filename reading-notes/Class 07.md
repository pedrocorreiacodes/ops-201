#### Reading: Should you Learn Poweshell?

------

**PowerShell** os a command-line shell interface made by Microsoft that enables system administrators and power users to manage computers from the command line. It is also a **scripting language** built on *.NET* that can be used to automate administrative taks and configuration management.

PowerShell **tasks** are generally performed using **cmdlets**.

PowerShell is an interpreted language for *doing* things.

Both Bash and PowerShell rely on the concept of the **pipeline**.PowerShell pipes objects, passing along the output of the *cmdlet* as the input for another one. This means **PowerShell** pushes around structured data. Bash shells push around gobs of text.

5 reasons to learn PowerShell

- **Automation** – you’ll be faster
- **Accuracy** – reduce mistakes
- **Versatility** – learning once enhances you everywhere
- **Community** – PowerShell has one of the most connected and welcoming communities in tech. Plugging into it will only help you become a better admin/engineer
- **Relevant** – PowerShell continues to grow and be adopted. If you’re not learning it, you won’t remain competitive in the job market

#### Reading: Who needs malware?

------

PowerShell script attacks are on the rise. According to researchers with *IBM's X-Force*, in 2018 just 43 per cent of the attacks it analyzed utilized any sort of locally installed files.

This means that admins can no longer worry just about detecting malicious executable and similar data on hard drives and other storage to identify cyber-intrusion.

These kind of attacks runentirely in memory using **PowerShell**, where this scripting language comes into play to perform malicious acts. It's possible to wrap protections around PowerShell to spot it being abused, such as requirig scripts to be **digitally signed**.

Also true social engineering attack remains as effective as it has ever been. 29 per cent of the attacks  *IBM's X-Force* analyzed were phishing attacks, and 45 per cent of those were targeted attacks on specific employees

#### Video: What is a Powershell attack?

------

*Malicious Power Shell User* is a *Living Off The Land* type of attack, meaning the attacker makes use of common tools on a network. Because they use software, applications, cloud and protocols that you trust, these attacks are very hard to detect.

They blend in normally with system administration work. What may look like normal every day end point activity, could be an advanced attack going through the system. 

One of the most common tools used in this attack is **Powershell**.
