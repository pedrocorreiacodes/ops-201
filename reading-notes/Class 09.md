##### What is a SOP?

SOP stands for **standad operating procedure**, a procedure specific for a company or organization that describes the steps and activities necessary to complete a particular task.

According to *So, You Want to Write an SOP? by Doug Tedder* documentation should be in bite-sized chunks with each document having a clear purpose.

SOPs are a primary way to implement or enforce a policy, policies without SOPs are not actionable.

Writing SOPs can be challenging because there are no hard rules for writing them. A particular format may work well on an organization and not so well in another organization.

SOPs require to be regularly maintained. If SOPs don't keep up with the fast changing business and IT they will become obsolete.

According to *So, You Want to Write an SOP? by Doug Tedder*  there is no right or wrong way to write an SOP, but there are several things that one must consider when writing an SOP. SOPs must be:

- **Readable.** This means legible font sizes, numbered pages, titles, numbered paragraph headings, and effective use of whitespace.
- **Consumable.** Using a template or predefined format makes the content easy to read.
- **Understandable.** To be effective, SOPs must be focused and to the point, using relevant, but simple terms.
- ***Actionable.** SOPs must clearly and succinctly describe what is to be done.
- ***Measurable.** The activities described within an SOP must be specific and measurable.

Sops must be created with a plan in mind. Must be concise and readable with sufficient depth without being overwhelming. Keep it on the general range of five to seven steps

Every SOP must open with a overview paragraph that briefly describes the topic of the SOP, inputs, output, expected results, and involved roles.

*Doug Tedder* follows five guiding principles when writing a SOP:

- **Keep it simple.** The SOP should augment and reinforce training; it is not a substitute for training.
- **SOPs must be portable.** Even if an underpinning application or tool is changed, the “what, when, and why” generally will not.
- **Flowcharts and diagrams tell a story.** Having a flowchart or diagrams (as appropriate) is a great way to quickly communicate what activities are addressed within the SOP.
- **Consistency counts.** Develop and use a consistent format or template to help make the SOP consumable.
- **It’s about the audience.** If the SOP does not work for your audience, your SOP doesn’t work. Conduct regular periodic reviews of SOPs with the people that use them to identify and incorporate improvements.
