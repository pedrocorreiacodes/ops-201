#### CompTIA A+ 220-902 Troubleshooting Methodology

---

The first step is understanding the problem, document the symptoms and if possible duplicate it.

If multiple issues are happening simultaneously break them up into individual problems and then go through this same troubleshooting process with each one of those individually.

Start with the most obvious issues. The simplest explanation is often the most likely.

Start testing the theories that we have that might be causing a particular issue.

Implement the solution afer successfully identifying which one of your theories actually solves the problem.

Expect the unexpected, it's good to have a primary plan and backup plans.

After applying the fix, test it and make sure that the fix solved the problem.

Create preventative measures so that the problem doesn't occur in the future. Document it in the knowledge base, so that if anyone else run across this particular issue theyÂ´ll know how to address it.
