And the deleted *Test.txt* file is back on the desktop.

System recovery operations are a fundamental skill to have when dealing with computer systems, they'll eventually malfunction and we have to be ready to deal with that. In all cases data backup is a priority, data is sacred, we most prevent data loss and implement data recovery tools anywhere possible.

Veeam setup can be tricky and a little *overkill* out of the box. For teaching purposes is better to install the Veeam agent than the whole suite.

In an increasing scale we'll have to make sure the infrastructure grows accordingly, meaning dedicated servers for backup and users with well configured backup jobs in each account.

A full clone is an independent copy of a virtual machine that shares nothing with the parent virtual machine after the cloning operation.

A linked clone is a copy of a virtual machine that shares virtual disks with the parent virtual machine in an ongoing manner.

With *Current machine state*, the new machine will have no snaptshots.

With Current machine state, the new machine will reflect the current state of the original machine with all the snapshots.

Cloning.

This feature is usefull to create scenarios with multiple VM's sharing the same initial setup.

Logs for the startup and shutting down of the VM.

Generally speaking logs are usefull to maintain a debug a program. With logs we can assert where something went wrong, usually that's the frist step to solve an issue.

The tools are very similar to *Event Viewer* althought *Event Viewer* is more robust and offers more features and the creation and reutilization of custom logs and views.
