Next to repro the problem as Bob we open `User Accounts` to change Bob's password in order to login into his account (this of course should be done with the user's consent):

Seems to be a problem with program used to open this kind of file (`.doc`) by default, so we have to change that:

Change it from `Paint`to `Apache Open Office` Also we made sure to create a shortcut for the `.exe`of Open Office and not for the whole program folder like it was previously on the user's account. Describe this procedure in Spiceworks and close the ticket.
