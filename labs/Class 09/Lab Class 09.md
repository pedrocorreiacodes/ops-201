### Part 2: Welcome Email

```
Dear Dwight,

Welcome to the company!

You can now log in your company Desktop PC with the username 'd.schrute' and the password 'd.schrute'. After your first logon you should immediately change the default password.

Thunderbird is already configured with your email credentials and you can access it from your desktop. This will be your primary tool for email management.

Foxit Phantom is also configured on your machine, all of your pdf files will open into Foxit Phantom PDF by default.

You'll have acess to a secondary hard drive on your computer, 'Dwight Schrute (E:)'. Feel free to use it for all of your data backup needs.

Your account is already configure for remote work. Further instructions on how to proceed to establish a remote connection will follow.

Feel free to contact me anytime. 

Kind regards.
John Smith
